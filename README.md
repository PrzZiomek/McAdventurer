The Web map application enables users to discover destinations, by showing typed locations on an interactive map,
providing information about places, such as pictures, descriptions, references, and hints to further explore. 
The project is at an early stage - so far the app allows the user to find a given destination on the map and show
the name of the clicked location. Furthermore, the app will be turned into a PWA (Progressive Web Application) and next 
functionalities will be added or improved, and the app will also be uploaded to the internet.


Concepts and technology stack:

- the frontend part of the app is written in ReactJS, using React Hooks, Styled Components and more

- accessability provided by using WCAG2 standards

- the backend part is written in Node.js with Express.js framework

- state managed by Redux and Redux-Saga 

- integration tests of the app state, with the use of redux-saga and redux-saga-test-plan libraries

- sourcing data from several external APIs, like the Wikipedia API

- arranging data with the MySQL database

- all together bundled with Webpack.
